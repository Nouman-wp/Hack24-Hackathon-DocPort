        <h3>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS enables web designers and developers to separate content from design, allowing for greater control over layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is fundamental in creating visually engaging and well-structured websites. It allows for the customization of HTML elements to ensure that a web page looks exactly as intended across various devices and screen sizes.
        </p>
        <h4>Key Features of CSS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Selectors and Properties</h5>
                <p>
                    CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styling rules. Properties define how the selected elements should be styled, such as color, font-size, and margins.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Box Model</h5>
                <p>
                    The CSS box model describes how elements are structured and sized. It includes content, padding, border, and margin areas that influence the overall layout of the page.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Responsive Design</h5>
                <p>
                    CSS enables responsive design through media queries, which adjust the layout and styling of a web page based on the device's screen size and resolution.
                </p>

            <li>

                <p>
                    CSS provides advanced layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid, which facilitate complex layouts and alignments with ease.
