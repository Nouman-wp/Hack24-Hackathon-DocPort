        <h3>JavaScript: The Programming Language of the Web</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is primarily used for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of websites. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables dynamic content and advanced features on web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            With JavaScript, developers can create interactive effects, manage data, and communicate with servers asynchronously, providing a more engaging and responsive user experience.
        </p>
        <h4>Key Features of JavaScript:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Event Handling</h5>
                <p>
                    JavaScript allows developers to respond to user actions and events, such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs, enabling dynamic interactions on web pages.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>DOM Manipulation</h5>
                <p>
                    JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify the content and structure of web pages in real-time, allowing for dynamic updates without reloading the page.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Asynchronous Programming</h5>
                <p>
                    JavaScript supports asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, enabling efficient handling of tasks such as API requests and data processing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Frameworks and Libraries</h5>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which facilitate the development of complex and scalable web applications.
                </p>
