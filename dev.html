            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It includes both frontend and backend development. Frontend development focuses on what users interact with directly, using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Backend development handles server-side tasks like data processing and storage, utilizing languages such as Python, Java, or PHP, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. Full-stack development covers both frontend and backend, offering a complete solution. Web design, including UI and UX design, enhances the visual appeal and user experience of a site. Tools and frameworks, such as React for frontend and Django for backend, streamline the development process. Once developed, websites are hosted and deployed on servers, and require ongoing maintenance for performance and security. Web development is a dynamic field, constantly evolving with new technologies and best practices.</p>
