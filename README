DocPort - Hack24 Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the DocPort project! This guide will help you set up the project on your local machine.

Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Download and Extract the Project**
   - Download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer.

2. **Create the Project Folder Structure**
   - Create a folder named `Hack24 project` in the location where you extracted the files. This will be the main directory for your project.

3. **Organize the Files**
   - Inside the `Hack24 project` folder, create the following three subfolders:
     - `css`
     - `js`
     - `images`

4. **Place the Files in the Appropriate Folders**
   - **CSS Files:** Move all CSS files into the `css` folder.
   - **JavaScript Files:** Move all JavaScript files into the `js` folder.
   - **HTML Files:** Ensure that all HTML files remain directly in the `Hack24 project` folder (not in any subfolder).
   - **Images and Videos:** Move all image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.) and `.mp4` video files into the `images` folder.

Final Structure

Your project folder should have the following structure:

Hack24 project/ │ ├── css/ │ └── [all your CSS files] │ ├── js/ │ └── [all your JavaScript files] │ ├── images/ │ └── [all your images and .mp4 files] │ └── [all your HTML files]


Conclusion

After organizing the files as described above, your project setup is complete. You can now open the HTML files in your browser to view and test the website.
